# Approach -- approximate and iterate

I really want Cuis on a RiscV64 with compile-to-native.

I have been looking at Pinocchio, OpenSmalltalk, and Bee runtimes but
want something less complex.

The thought is to do "the simplest thing that will work" in Cuis
to generate a metacircular Smalltalk native runtime, then add
OS native support for UI, events, files, sockets .. working toward
a full Cuis IDE (a.k.a. _Cuis Userland_)

## Essentials: What Makes Cuis Cuis?

- Full IDE: Refactoring Tools, Syntax Hilighting, Code Completion
- Minimalist -- all code must carry its own weight (Base < 700 Classes)
- Composition/Modularity -- Features Provided by  versioned Packages
- Morphic 3: Antialiased Scalable Vector Graphics & TT Fonts
- Unified Unicode
- Compiletime constant literals (backquote, e.g `1@2`).
- and of course: ANSI Smalltalk Standard (such as it is..)


Pole Star Goal: Load any Cuis Package and use it without change.

VM Support Makes Problems:
 - LiveTyping
 - FFI
 - Plugins

## Open Question(s)

Both Pinocchio and Bee made changes to separate Class shape from behavior.
What changes to Cuis Class Hierarchy might be required to minimize
differences between Cuis Userland and Vanilla (current) Cuis?
