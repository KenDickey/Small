# Runtime Model

Smalltalk is meant to be a small and simple language.
The syntax is simple and basic opearations consist of Message Send, Return, and Assignment.
Smalltalk Objects hold values, receive and send messages.
The Wikipedia.org page on Smalltalk had a good description of this.

Mapping from the source language, Smalltalk, to the target machine, RISC-V RV64G,
means comparing the two world views and concentrating on the differences.

Smalltalk is also well known for maintaining the dual view of the relation
between text source and machine binary runtime and displaying machine state
in comprhensible ways.
