# Runtime Model

Smalltalk is meant to be a small and simple language _for the user_.
The syntax is minimal and basic opearations consist of Message Send, Return, and Assignment.
Smalltalk Objects hold values, receive and send messages.
The Wikipedia.org page on Smalltalk had a good description of this.

Mapping from the source language, Smalltalk, to the target machine, RISC-V RV64G or Aarch64/ARMv8,
means comparing the two world views and concentrating on the differences.
[Note "Realisitic Compilation by Program Transformation", Kelsey & Hudak, 1989]
(https://hashingit.com/elements/research-resources/1989-01-realistic-compilation-by-program-transformation.pdf)
[RV64GC Specs: (https://riscv.org/technical/specifications/)] 

Smalltalk is also well known for maintaining the dual view of the relation
between text source and machine binary runtime and displaying machine state
in comprhensible ways.
["Design Principles Behind Smalltalk", Dan Ingalls, 1981]
(http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~evans/cs655/readings/smalltalk.html)

As all objects know how to present themselves, the "simple to use" language
has complex underpinnings, e.g. Garbage Collection and access to the runtime
stack frames via #thisContext.

This document collects ideas for an RISC "asm up" runtime system with adequate performance
as a simplified "backstop runtime".

## Runtime Globals

There exists a vector/array of objects known as the Known Objects Array.

One known object is the SystemDictionary named #Smalltalk.

Basically, all globals known to code are either local values
(Instance Variables or Method Temporaries) or are
names in the Smalltalk Dictionary.

There is a segmented table of ClassID -> Behavior, where a Behavior is a
dictionary of (Method Selector Symbol -> Method).
One of the selectors is #class, so each object knows its class.
All objects have behaviors -- they are useless otherwise.
Sending a message to an object is achieved by looking up the message
selector in the object's behavior dictionary (or those of its
ancestors) and invoking that method with the object and other
arguments.  This is explained further below.

## Object Layout Format

All entities in Smalltalk are known as Objects.
To do anything, Messages are sent to Objects.
There is nothing else.

All the machine knows are bits, either in memory or registers.

The basics of managing the bits to represent information is well covered in
David Gudeman's paper: 
"Representing Type Information in Dynamically Typed Languages"
https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.39.4394&rep=rep1&type=pdf

In short, Smalltalk Objects are represented as either
_Immediate Values_, those which fit in a machine register,
or
_Vector-Like Objects_, an array, the first part of which is a Header,
which encodes clues to its size and structure) and an optional part which is
interpreted either as Smalltalk Objects (A compact array of Slots) or
binary data (e.g. a ByteVector).

We are using OpenSmalltalkVM's "Spur" header format
(refs below; see "Spur Object Format").

Key ideas: Horizontal vs Vertical Encoding and Hashing.

_Dictionarys_ map _Keys_ to _Values_.
Each Smalltalk object responds to a method #hash which reponds with a SmallInteger
which is used to shorten key lookup time. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_table]

_Horizontal Encoding_ maps categories to bits which can be tested individually,
e.g. (#sphere->1, #cube->2, #ball->4, #rectangel->8, #square->16).
This is used where there are few
categories and an object may be classified in 
multiple categories (e.g. Sphere+Ball, Square+Rectangle)

_Vertical Encodings_ are just consecutive numbers and may be used where there are many categories,
each of which is distinct from all others.
E.g. (#point->1, #line->2, #triangle->3, #rectangle->4, #pentagram->5, #hexagram->6)

Most immediate values (small integers, floats, characters) and object header format
is well described in Clément Béra: "Spur’s new object format"
https://clementbera.wordpress.com/2014/01/16/spurs-new-object-format/
(Other refs below).

One counter-intuitive win here is the
use of ClassIndex rather than a pointer to a class.
This loses because one has to index into a table
to get an object's Behavior, an extra indirection.
But the win is that one makes for cheap class checks
at each method's inline cache callsite
and these sites do not have to be scanned by GC.
Also, the majority of basic classes are together so the
indexing tends to keep the first section of the class table
in cache, reducing the cost.

Most values are known by the tag in their lower 3 bits.
- 2r000 -> Object Oriented Pointer, or _OOP_.
- 2r001 -> Small (limited range) Integer
- 2r010 -> Small Floating Point Number, or _float_.
- 2r110 -> Also an immediate Float (Upper bit extends exponent)
- 2r100 -> Character

Three immediate values are special: _true_, _false_, and _nil_.
The trick here is that we don't use OOP addresses near zero.  
So _nil_, _true_, and _false_ are known by their small values, which
are easy to create and check in code.

- UndefinedObject/Nil = 0  [So matches register ZERO = x0]
- False = 8 = 2r01000
- True = 16 = 2r10000

Most values are initialized to _nil_, so writing zeros makes initialization easy.
It is assumed (need to test this) that the ease of initialization and use
will compensate for the irregulatiry in testing.  We shall see.

Given Spur's class index, the start of the Class Behavior table should contain
````
-  1 -> SmallInteger	[masked tag bits]
-  2 -> Float	  	[masked tag bits]
-  3 -> Float	 	[masked tag bits]
-  4 -> Character    	[masked tag bits]
-  ...
-  8 -> True		[Immediate Value]
- ...
- 16 -> False		[Immediate Value]
````
Other indexes are same as class index = hash value.


## Runtime Model

The foregoing gave a brief overview of how objects (data+behavior) are represented in memory.
Here we describe the basics of the _GR8 runtime execution model_, how the Central
Processing Unit or _CPU_ uses the Stack and Registers to process instructions and
drive computation forward.

Method objects contain references to "literal values", code, and information about the
method such as it's Selector symbol, number of arguments, use of registers and stack,
if it generates ^returns, if it may generate blocks which can "escape" to live longer than
the stack frame/thisContext and may hold captured references to values in the
visible/lexical environment.

There may be multiple "entry points" into the main body of the code, some of which do
extra checks on the kind of arguments acceptable.
E.g. low-level addition of two small integers
requires a _guard_ to assure that both arguments are indeed small integers.
DoIt to the text "3 + 4" in a Workspace invokes ```SmallInteger>>+```.
The #+ method of the SmallInteger object 3 requires one SmallInteger argment.
If this is the case, then the simple method code adds its _self_ object, 3, to
its argument, 4, to get 7 which it gives back as the result of the method send.

If, however we try "3 + 643872648732674863287462387648723648723687423" the #+ method
notes that its argument in a LargeInteger (or _BigNum_) and a more complex calculation
is required.

"Compelling, detailed example here, w regs + stack usage."
" Perhaps allocate and initialize an object "


## Registers & Stack

We will use more registers, but stack layout might be patterned after the Bee DMR.
http://esug.org/data/ESUG2014/IWST/Papers/iwst2014_Design%20and%20implementation%20of%20Bee%20Smalltalk%20Runtime.pdf

Note especially: Allen Wirfs-Brock: "Efficient Implementation of Smalltalk Block Returns"
http://www.wirfs-brock.com/allen/things/smalltalk-things/efficient-implementation-smalltalk-block-returns

RISC-V Stack grows down and is quadword aligned. Pointers are 8 bytes in width.
Stack records are between the chained FramePointer regs,
which point to base of stack frame, and the StackPointer itself.

Stack Frames should be Context objects (with specialized object headers to denote
RawBits vs OOPS fields).

```
Note: For GC, a Method knows its number of args, objTemps, binaryTemps.

Note: To interpret/convert frames into Context objects
requires tracking spills and registers.
If each method knows its frame size, then just push a MethodContext Header and set its size
and info fields.
Zero out stack slots at frame alloc.
At time of debug or exception, traverse stack
and perform reg->stack spills before dereferencing MethodContexts.
Get newest thisContext from current FramePointerReg and backchain FramePointers to traverse
(e.g. for GC).

CPU Regs are known as (partition) "bits" or "OOPS" and
only the OOPS get scanned by GC.
Methods know this.

To avoid "deep spill problem" (lazy caller-save register spill, deeply nested return must restore)
the invariant is that such regs must be "eagerly" spilled before block escapes, known by compiler
[?annotate in MethodContext Header flags?]

Saved regs alloc'ed for loop constructs to be "rare" relative to blocks to minimize spills.
[Investigate ping/pong/coroutine register cooperation patterns].

Do simple rules for "register tracking" for debug
as to what/when on stack and what/when in regs
and annotate special case details in code.

Basically we want "objects all the way down"

First class Slots and Object Layout description objects.

CPU as object where register and memory access is via specialized Slot semantics.
CPU leaf methods inlined [Millicode/Primops/UnderPrims].
CPU regs are either OOPS or RawBits.
Likewise for fields of Stack Frame Context objects (GC only scans OOPS).

OS object encapsulates OS Services (System Calls, Devices, I/O; MicroKernel)


### Register Allocation

Yin Wang and R. Kent Dybvig:
"Register Allocation By Model Transformer Semantics"
https://arxiv.org/pdf/1202.5539.pdf


## Message Invocation & CallSite Caching

After Bee and Pinocchio, we separate lookup from invocation.
Or ````#invoke```` = ````#lookup```` then ````#perform````.

Lookup takes an object, the receiver, and a selector and finds either
the requisite method or substitutes a DNU.

Basically:
````Smalltalk
invoke: selector
  <invoke>
  |method behavior|
  behavior := self behavior.
  method := behavior lookup: selector for: self
  "Cache this, see below"
  ↑ method performUnchecked: selector on: self.

lookup: selector
  |class dictionary|
  class := self class.
  [ class == nil ] whileFalse: [
      dictionary := class methodDictionary.
      (dictionary at: selector)
          ifNotNil: [ :method | ↑ method ].
      class := class superclass
   ].
   ↑ self doesNotUnderstand.
````

So method call at the register level is
````
R0 <- Receiver
S  <- Selector
A0... <- Spread Arguments or Argvector
Target <- Method[CallSiteIndex]
GoTo/Jump (Target)
````
Where Method[call-sites..] slots are initialized to #invoke.

This is a Monomorphic cache.  On first invoke, the #invoke method knows that
Method[CallIndex] is the location in memory to place the address of the
found method.  The second invoke goes directly to this method.

The ````#performUnchecked:on:```` skips the class check at the start
of a just found method, but
subsequent calls always execute the call check method prefix.  If class
is not correct, the backup/recovery invoke does not do caching, but
may "copy-down" polymorphic methods to current (sub)behavior method dictionary.

The rationale of jumping to a call site address which is an indexed
slot in a Method object is to separate possibly read-only executable
code from where we expect to write.  Method code is allocated/linked
as a sharable code page (read+execute) as a word-vector.  The method
itself is an object with both named and indexed variables.
````
           Header
Method --> Named Slots.. (code,homeClassIndex,selector)
           Indexed Slots.. (cached method addresses)
````
Method code is pinned and does not need to be scanned by GC.  The _indexed
slot method address cache_ part of a Method object does not need to
be scanned.  [Base Language runtime for embedding does not have compiler].

Polymorphic call sites are fewer, but possible to allocate caches and jump
to them using the same mechanics.
````
Note: OpenSmalltalk-VM Observes
- Monomorphic        3566        90.4%
- Polymorphic         307         7.8%
- Megamorphic          70         1.8%
````
An alternative to Polymorphic caches is to do a "copy down" of _only_
un-overwridden polymorphic methods to subclass dictionaries.  This will
limit polymorphic lookup to one dictionary access.  If not in
the first probe, we can safely return a DNU (after copydown).
This requres check & fixup by IDE 
when override added but is small cost at method compile time.
This can be done lazily by method prolog's class check
if the method selector is found in a superclass dictionary.  


## Cool things from Pinocchio

- Break infinite regress by having a Formal late binding, but use
method "type hints" to early bind immutable monomorphic call sites.
- Write out ELF files to leverage gnu utils (ld, readelf, ..) and gdb.
- Runtime spec is just prefixed classes (e.g. 'P4') which use introspection
to get method source. => Already lexed+compiled in host system, so no
syntax errors. (assuming valid host Smalltalk).  Easy to package.

## Cool things from Bee

- Complete metacircular core Smalltalk, including GC [Pinocchio is partial].
- UnderPrims (a.k.a. "millicode")
- Methods store encoded ASTs which can be nativised to local CPU when loaded.
- Separate VM spec. (good and bad;
relies on Tonel format; more likely to have syntax errors)


## Optimization Ideas [try 'em and measure]

? #isA pattern: Just a subclass test.  Use sorted vector of ClassIndexes (highest first).
Linear search.  Per-class.

Make "type tests" visible to be "lifted out" or "propagated forward".
I.e. in a Method, if the first send does a check for an argument being a SmallInteger,
if the test passed, then no other sends need to re-check for this object again.
All succeeding SmallInteger tests can be elided (the tested object's "type" 
has become resolved).

Small Objects who's lifetimes don't extend beyond the lifetime of
a method invocation could be stack-allocated.

Within the context of a Class, trivial slot accessors could be open-coded.  On
the other hand, first class Slot definition objects are interesting.

With argument literals, one could preform subclass tests at compile time;
other constant propagarion.
This requires recompilation when overrides.

Inlining: Use #Pragmas/<annotations> to annotate known objects and known
operations with goal that, e.g. boolean
inlining is part of generic optimization & value propagation.

Known Objects
 - true, false, nil [literal 16/8/0 in code]
 - literals: numbers, string, char, arrays, byteVectors, `<compile-time-results>`

Known Operations [core subset -- early bound w late bound fallback]
 - Booleans: #ifTrue: ...
 - Blocks: #whileTrue: ...
 - Math: + - * // \\ squared ...
 - Collections: #to:do: ...
